# Todolist

## Core

1. All nodes should have queueing and non-queueing input-mode (selectable, queueing as default).

## LIB

0. Add tag passing to all nodes.
1. Check if networking supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP and implement missing.
2. Add object constructor, extractor (read) and deconstructor/splitter to enable complex object creation and handling.
3. Add encryption package that encrypts messages
4. Add Queue that queues all messages and only passes those with matching tags (Actually reorders so that the tags match)
5. Implement Array/Vector package

## Editor

1. Improve subgraph handling and editing, autodetect inputs and outputs for upper graph-level node.
2. List availible graphs.
3. Buttons should be HTML and not canvas. (Allows simpler png export of graphs for showing something)
